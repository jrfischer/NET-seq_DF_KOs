# The NET-seq data associated with our study are stored in the netseq_wigs folder.
# They consist of the NET-seq reads mapped to each genomic location on the plus and minus strands 
# in the indicated strains (WT or KO mutants) and are contained in the following wig files:

# WT.minus.wig and WT.plus.wig,
# WTPilot.minus.wig and WTPilot.plus.wig,
# ccr4.minus.wig and ccr4.plus.wig,
# dhh1.minus.wig and dhh1.plus.wig,
# lsm1.minus.wig and lsm1.plus.wig,
# rpb4.minus.wig and rpb4.plus.wig,
# xrn1.minus.wig and xrn1.plus.wig,
# xrn1Pilot.minus.wig and xrn1Pilot.plus.wig

# We used the files GSE49026_S-TSS.txt and GSE49026_S-PAS.txt for annotations of TSS and PAS.

# Other files correspond to external data sets which augment our analyses as indicated in the manuscript.
